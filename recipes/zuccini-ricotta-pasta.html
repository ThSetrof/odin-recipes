    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium zucchinis, sliced or grated</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (plus more for garnish)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped (or use fresh parsley for a different flavor)</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon (optional for brightness)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional for heat)</li>
        <li>12 oz pasta (like spaghetti, linguine, or penne)</li>
    </ul>
      

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente according to package instructions. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.</li>
        <li>Add the zucchini, season with salt and pepper, and sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine ricotta, Parmesan cheese, lemon zest (if using), and red pepper flakes. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the zucchini. Pour in the ricotta mixture and a bit of the reserved pasta water, stirring everything together until creamy. Add more pasta water as needed to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped basil or parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with extra Parmesan and a sprinkle of fresh basil or parsley, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
